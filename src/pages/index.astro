      <h1>üëã Hi, I'm Ryan,</h1>
      <div class="hero">
        <p>
          Greetings, fellow developers and aviation enthusiasts! I am not just a
          developer, but a connoisseur of engineering leadership and a complete
          aviation nerd. I believe in the power of dreams and see art in every
          facet of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let me tell you a little secret ‚Äì I have a passion for sharing
          knowledge. It all started as an addiction to learning. Some might say
          I was trapped in tutorial hell for over 15 years, but I beg to differ.
          I simply adore exploring new perspectives. Now, I want to distill my
          own best practices and share them through tutorials. Oh, and by the
          way, testing is definitely a thing! Trust me on this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm working on building a learning platform. Yes, I know
          what you're thinking ‚Äì there are already 200 similar platforms out
          there. But here's the twist: mine is absolutely free. I firmly believe
          that knowledge should not come at a cost. And hey, I'm still learning
          too, so it's a win-win-win situation!
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past year, I've been knee-deep in TypeScript, Next.JS 13,
          Remix, Three.js, and even tinkering with SvelteKit and Astro.build
          (this very site is an Astro site, by the way). I've been exploring the
          fascinating world of OpenAI and indulging in some "edgy" computing ‚Äì
          which is just a fancy way of saying I've been re-learning caching
          techniques. My love for UI development comes in waves, and after a few
          years, I often roll back to the backend. Right now, I'm rediscovering
          the joys of CSS and finding that less-is-more when it comes to
          styling. Who would have thought?
        </p>

        <p>
          As a true adventurer, you'll find me dabbling in SwiftUI, Kotlin,
          Flutter, and React Native. Do I have a favorite? Absolutely not. Each
          of them brings a unique set of solutions to the challenges they were
          designed for, in my humble opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to backend languages, GoLang and Elixir hold a special
          place in my heart. Although, lately, the Bun-based projects have been
          adding some spice to my TypeScript-infused world!
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a penchant for working with large datasets. There's something
          exhilarating about rewriting Airflow services into stream-based
          services using Erlang, Scala, or Go. I can't pinpoint exactly when or
          where this fascination began, but I suspect it was during my time at
          HG Insights while devouring the book on Concurrent Data Processing in
          Elixir. It all just made too much sense!
        </p>

        <p>
          And speaking of Elixir and Erlang, let me confess my love for embedded
          projects. Perhaps my closet is brimming with toys from SparkFun. The
          idea of controlling hardware with software has always captivated me.
          Who knows, someday, I might even have the knowledge to build my own
          experimental helicopter and end up making headlines! Just imagine the
          chaos!

          I like to write tutorials, education has become a hobby of mine. It
          started as an addiction to learning, some would say I was stuck in
          tutorial hell for 15+ years, I disagree, I simply love learning new
          perspectives. I now want to share those perspectives into what I have
          distilled down as my own best-practices, btw... testing is a thing!

        <p>
          I'm currently building a learning platform, you know, like the 200
          that exist. Mine is free as I do not like charging for knowledge, and
          my time, well let's call it what it is, I am still learning, it's a
          win-win-win>

        <p>
          Over the past year you would see me heavily using TypeScript, Next.JS
          13, Remix, Three.js, (tinkering with SvelteKit & Astro.build / this
          site is an Astro site) way too much OpenAI usage, a lot of `edge`
          computing which is a nice way of saying re-learning caching lol. My
          love of the UI comes and goes, generally I will roll to the backend
          after a few years. As of rite now, the UI and once again re-learning
          CSS the proper way, I am finding once again less-is-more with styling
          ;)

          You will find me dabbling in SwiftUI, Kotlin, Flutter, and React
          Native. Do I have a favorite, nope, they all work for the challenges
          they were designed for in my opinion.

        <p>
          GoLang and Elixir are my favorite backend languages, although Bun
          based projects are looking üå∂Ô∏è for the TypeScript nerd in me!

          I like working with large datasets, I find it fun to re-write Airflow
          services in stream based services using Erlang, Scala, or Go. I do not
          know where I picked this up, I believe when I worked at HG Inisghts I
          was also reading Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir, it made too
          much sense!

          Speaking of Elixir/Erlang, I love embedded projects, perhaps I have a
          closet full of toys from SparkFun. Controlling hardware with software
          has always been one of my greatest interests. Some-day I will have the
          knowledge to build my own experimental helicopter and end up the news!
