        I am a developer, engineering leader, and complete aviation nerd. I am a
        believer, a dreamer, and I see art in every facet of life.

        <p>
          I am a builder; however, satisfaction does not come from my creations.
          My joy, insipriation, feeling of value comes from those that I may
          help with their creation. ‚ô•Ô∏è
