      <h1>Progs, Proggies, Projects...</h1>

      <p>
        I enjoy building useful and useless projects, some are for the kids,
        some are for me or the household, and some are simply me cloning
        projects to see if I can. Why the f@*k would you waste your time doing
        that Ryan? Good question, this is what is fun to me. I digress...

        >Note: To save time in my life, some of these projects are using Node
        and the serverrless paradigm from Vercel. Vercel has a cold boot time of
        around 3 seconds, so please be patient as I do not want to convert these
        all to the edge. Some services haul ass, they are either static, on the
        edge, or using Fly.io. I will write a post about this topic in time, I
        promise, I won't ðŸ¤£.</small

            An AI chatbot using Next 13.4, edge based streaming, the Vercel AI
            package and the Vercel KV for saving chats. I use the shit out of
            this daily as I personally, and I cannot stress this enough,
            personally, cannot stand the OpenAI UI.

            I love this little service and use it like it's going out of style,
            I <strong>do not</strong> use this service for non-simulated
            aviation, please... use Foreflight lol. If you are a big simmer like
            me as well, I love pulling this little tool out if I have my VR on,
            give it a quick look for ATIS and runways, and go back to enjoying
            that VFR! I do have a service I use that I am making pretty for
            flight planning. This service uses Remix, Sqlite (yup, distributed,
            LiteFS!), and well.. web standards. It just works, I forgot about
            it, a year later in my Fly dashboard it was chugging along, no
            updates needed, nothing, it just works. Having said that, Remix is
            very much an exploration model for me at best. I am waiting to see
            what Shopify and crew do with it ðŸš€

            My little journal that tells me how I am feeling based on my entry,
            and over time. This project leverages Next 13, Redis, MySql
            (PlanetScale), Prisma, Tailwind, all the crap essentially. I like
            it, my kids like it, my mother said it works so ya know... that's
            the feeedback right there!

            For the kids, they like D&D, I wanted to create a small "Reddit" for
            them. This uses Next, Redis, Prisma, Postgres, Tailwind, Vercels
            Edge, React Query... essentially the reason I am starting to like
            basic web applications and Remix again lmao. A lot of code to do ..
            not that much, but fun!

            Myself and the kids like to learn, they have to (so the school tells
            us), I want to. Pick any topic and this tool will query GPT 4 to
            create either an open ended test, or a multiple choice test. This is
            legit fun, uses alot of db vectoring, really fun prompt engineering
            and a good oppurtunity to make something useful.

            So Twitter is not a thing, or is it, who knows if the DNS will ever
            remove the 301 from twitter to x.com. Random... does anyone else
            feel dirty typing x.com? It's just fucking weird! Well, use this
            tool to create a new bio, for anything! Yes again, OpenAI, Edge,
            blah blah blah. You get where this is going.

            There internet would not be complete without another over-engineered
            CMS, cough, I mean a home rental site where people can steal your
            shit, wait that's not it... I think AirBnB has done some good. WTF
            Yogan... okay this was a good way to learn the newer app based
            router for Next 13, this uses MongoDB and serverless, so enjoy that
            cold boot!
